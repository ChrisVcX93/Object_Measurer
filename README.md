# Automated XSEM Measurer
- With the use of OpenCV library, images are converted into black and white images to produce a contours image only 
- Slide Bar created to let user decide betweeb sharpness of image and noise ,with more sharper images producing more contours but also more noise
- Python pandas used to convert these contours into X,Y coordinates 
- With a single click, algorithm developed able to measure the width/height of desired spots 
- Python Dash was used to port entire program into a web app
- Within web app, user is able to save the measurements and annotated images into a powerpoint slide deck for ease of viewing later
